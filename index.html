	      <h3>More info about this recording:</h3>

<p>Aaron loves the holiday classics sung by Darlene Love, Mariah Carey, and other stars, but didn't understand why that spirit has to be limited to Christmas. He wrote <strong>Love All Year</strong> to celebrate every holiday, and really any occasion when we share time with family and friends.</p>
<p>Oren read a few years back that Senator Orrin Hatch had written a Hanukkah song, and decided that if the Senator could do it, he could too. That led to <strong>Hanukkah Light</strong>.</p>
<p>Aaron heard <strong>Angels We Have Heard On High</strong> and, true to his calling as a music minister, saw an opportunity to talk from the heart about the true meaning of Christmas.</p>
<p>Percy and Aaron heard the amazing Victor Provost play jazz steel pan, and were inspired to take <strong>The Christmas Song</strong> to the Caribbean, where Santa is always overdressed for the weather.</p>
<p>Back in Washington, DC, Oren was actually listening to Clifford Brown as he rode through the snow, and came up with the first line of <strong>Snow Day</strong>, a musical musing about relationships and sub-freezing temperatures.</p>
<p>Oren and his wife told Aaron and friends about their disappointing trip out West in search of warmer weather, where they found rain in San Diego and, yes, snow in Las Vegas. Aaron started singing <strong>It's Snowing In Vegas</strong>, and the group put their heads together to write the lyrics, inspired by the unusual idea and a bottle of quite nice rum.</p>
<p>Finally, all year long, but especially around the holidays, the many tourists arriving in our Nation's Capital take advantage of our convenient Metro subway system. Oren wrote <strong>Stand Right</strong> to advise visitors on how to get along with their fellow riders.</p>
